# Self-directed Project Based Learning (PBL) Weekly Journal 

Weekly web pages used as a technical journal example for students at
the [Arlington Career Center](https://careercenter.apsva.us) in IT / CS
classes during Spring semester 2017.

In the process of modeling self-directed learning to my students, I'll use this
site to document the various IT / CS projects I'll be developing as part of
my own self-directed learning.
