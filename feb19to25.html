<h1>Advanced Topics Journal - Week of February 19 to 25, 2017</h1>

<main>
<h2>Day 1: The Plan</h2>
<p>
I have two goals for the coming week:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn to the latest CSS layout techniques using two tutorials - 
  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">A Complete
  Guide to Flexbox</a> and
  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid">A Complete
  Guide to Grid</a>.  Both of these tutorials are from the wonderful
  <a href="https://css-tricks.com">https://css-tricks.com</a> website.</li>

  <li>Continue to make progress going through
  <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">The Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>.
  I am currently in the middle of
  <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database">Part IV: Database</a> and have been
  posting my progress to a
  <a href="https://github.com">github</a> repository
  <a href="https://github.com/jelkner/flaskmicroblog">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted to use both grid layout and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries">media queries</a> to
style the pages for the <i>Unsung Sheroes of Computer Science</i> project for
our computer lab. After some quick investigation, I came across
<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid">this</a> page, which makes clear
that I'm a wee bit early on using grid.  It will be supported in Firefox 52.
I'm currently running Firefox 51, so support is on its way, but I perfer to
wait at least until the current Ubuntu version of Firefox support what I'm
learning.
</p><p>
Instead of a using a grid layout, I just applied the <code>table-row</code>
and <code>table-cell</code> display types to child elements of a
<code>figure</code> element to achieve the layout I wanted.  I started with
Edzon's work on the <i>Unsung Sheroes</i> and modified it to produce
<a href="../sheroes">this</a> result.
</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>
I completed
<a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database">The Flask Mega-Tutorial, Part IV: Database</a> this morning.  My
git commit for this is
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/ScientificProgramming/blob/31084973712328bd1cc996d62b94d11b80b76eeb/guassjordan/gaussian_elimination_gencase.py">here</a>.
</p><p>
Since many Web II students will be starting to learn about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> this week,
I went searching for good resources to supplement our CIW materials. One
promising site is
<a href="http://www.codeconquest.com/blog/top-50-websites-to-learn-javascript">
Top 50 Websites to Learn JavaScript</a>. One gem I found on the list is
<a href="http://jsforcats.com">JavaScript for Cats</a>, which as a cat lover
myself, I found appealing from the start ;-)
</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p>
Two significant accomplishments completed today!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I reviewed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Gaussian
elimination</a> and created a Python program using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SymPy">SymPy</a> to transform a general
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_matrix">augmented matrix</a>
into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_echelon_form">row echelon form</a>.
I added that program to my
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/ScientificProgramming">Scientific
Programming</a> github repository
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/ScientificProgramming/blob/31084973712328bd1cc996d62b94d11b80b76eeb/guassjordan/gaussian_elimination_gencase.py">here</a>.
</li>

<li>
I setup an Ubuntu 16.04 web server in the classroom and transferred all user
accounts from the public student web server to the in classroom one.  During
class I varified that students could login to the local server and see there
web files.  Tomorrow I'll show students how to use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> utility to synchronize
files between the two servers.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Day 4: Evaluation</h2>
<p>
I had two goals for this week: learn more advanced CSS layout techniques and
move forward with a study of Flask.  I made significant progress on both goals,
but I had to adjust the resources I planned to use with each. Grid layout is
not yet ready, so I went back to using a combination of
<code>display: table-row</code> and <code>display: table-cell</code> to get
the layout I wanted. The Flask tutorial I began at the beginning of the week
proved unsuitable by the middle of the week for reasons described, so I had to
search out alternative resources.
