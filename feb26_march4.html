<h1>Journal for Week of February 26 to March 4, 2017</h1>

<main>
<h2>Day 1 - Sunday, Feb. 26: The Plan</h2>
<p>
This weekend has seen one disaster after another. The video card on my desktop
computer failed immediately after I had installed new hard drives. I ordered
a replacement, which should arrive from Amazon tomorrow. Next, after sitting
down in front of my labtop (since the desktop is out of commission), the first
thing I wanted to do was add my last journal entry, only to find that <i>my
journal file was missing!</i> The <code>feb19to25.html</code> file I had been
editing all week was just not there. I'll check on the web server in the
classroom to see if I have a backup. It had much valuable information in it,
and I'll really be sorry to loose it.  Well, when life gives you lemons,
<i>make lemonade!</i>
</p>

<h3>Lemonade</h3>
<p>
My first goal for the week will be to get more students using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>. Since I don't every
want to loose my journal again, the first thing I did this week was to add
it to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)">repository
</a> and put it on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/pcbtechjournal">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Back to the Plan</h3>
<p>
My main goal this week will be to revise and update the
<a href=http://ict.gctaa.net/sections/resources/journal.html">Weekly BPL
Technical Journal</a> page and introduce it to all my classes to help lead
students down the path of self-directed learning.  I had created a seperate
version of this document for each section, but given the work involved in
refining it, having a single instance linked from all sections will make the
work much more bearable.
</p>


<h2>Day 2 - Monday, Feb. 27</h2>
<p>
Exceptionally bad days tend to be followed by better ones (a simple statistical
fact). When I arrived in school today I found the missing journal file on the
classroom webserver. I copied it over to the rackspace server and commited it
to my git repository. It had useful information that I was happy to recover.
I plan to begin introducing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">github</a> to a few selected
students today. I'll choose students who are already doing very well in the
class and who can handle the extra learning load. Later I'll ask them to help
spread the knowledge to others.
