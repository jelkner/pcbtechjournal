<h1>Journal for Week of February 26 to March 4, 2017</h1>

<main>
<h2>Day 1 - Sunday, Feb. 26: The Plan</h2>
<p>
This weekend has seen one disaster after another. The video card on my desktop
computer failed immediately after I had installed new hard drives. I ordered
a replacement, which should arrive from Amazon tomorrow. Next, after sitting
down in front of my labtop (since the desktop is out of commission), the first
thing I wanted to do was add my last journal entry, only to find that <i>my
journal file was missing!</i> The <code>feb19to25.html</code> file I had been
editing all week was just not there. I'll check on the web server in the
classroom to see if I have a backup. It had much valuable information in it,
and I'll really be sorry to loose it.  Well, when life gives you lemons,
<i>make lemonade!</i>
</p>

<h3>Lemonade</h3>
<p>
My first goal for the week will be to get more students using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>. Since I don't every
want to loose my journal again, the first thing I did this week was to add
it to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)">repository
</a> and put it on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/pcbtechjournal">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Back to the Plan</h3>
<p>
My main goal this week will be to revise and update the
<a href=http://ict.gctaa.net/sections/resources/journal.html">Weekly BPL
Technical Journal</a> page and introduce it to all my classes to help lead
students down the path of self-directed learning.  I had created a seperate
version of this document for each section, but given the work involved in
refining it, having a single instance linked from all sections will make the
work much more bearable.
</p>


<h2>Day 2 - Monday, Feb. 27</h2>
<p>
Exceptionally bad days tend to be followed by better ones (a simple statistical
fact). When I arrived in school today I found the missing journal file on the
classroom webserver. I copied it over to the rackspace server and commited it
to my git repository. It had useful information that I was happy to recover.
I plan to begin introducing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">github</a> to a few selected
students today. I'll choose students who are already doing very well in the
class and who can handle the extra learning load. Later I'll ask them to help
spread the knowledge to others.
</p>

<h2>Day 3 - Tuesday, Feb. 28</h2>
<p>
Marco has been working on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How-to">How-to</a> for using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">screen</a> to share a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console">virtual console</a>
among the students in the class. This will allow us to write code together,
and provide an opportunity to practice interactive discipline, timing, and
effective communication at the same time we are learning Python, etc.
I'm coming in earnly tomorrow morning, so I plan to use that opportunity to
test out Marco's latest incarnation of the the How-to and share how it works
here.
</p><p>
In other news, the APS network lost
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> last night
during my evening class. In the past, this would have brought classwork to
a halt, but with the inhouse network Marco setup for us, students were able to
continue working without missing a beat!
</p>

<h2>Day 4 - Wednesday, March 1</h2>

<h3>7:29 am</h3>
<p>
Here is what I did as a first attempt at setting up a shared screen session:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Logged into rteitelbaum, the laptop connected to the projector in the
  front of the classroom.  Started an X terminal session and sshed from there
  to the ebgranville classroom web server.</li>

  <li>Logged in (using ssh) to ebgranville from my desktop workstation,
  ghopper, and ran the following commands:
  <pre>
  $ sudo chmod u+s $(which screen)
  $ sudo chmod 755 /var/run/screen 
  </pre></li>

  <li>Confirmed that my <code>.screenrc</code> file had the following:
  <pre>
  multiuser on

  # Grant users access to screen sessions
  acladd [username]
  ...
  acladd [username]
  </pre>
  and that my <code>.bash_aliases</code> file contained the following:
  <pre>
  # screen aliases
  screens() { screen -aAOS $1;}
  </pre></li>

  <li>Typed:
  <pre>
  $ screens sharedscreen1
  </pre>
  in the projected virtual console.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Marco's instructions don't explain how users connect to a screen session, so
I'll have to wait for him to read this and revise his instructions in response
before testing further.
