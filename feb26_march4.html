<h1>Journal for Week of February 26 to March 4, 2017</h1>

<main>
<h2>Day 1 - Sunday, Feb. 26: The Plan</h2>
<p>
This weekend has seen one disaster after another. The video card on my desktop
computer failed immediately after I had installed new hard drives. I ordered
a replacement, which should arrive from Amazon tomorrow. Next, after sitting
down in front of my labtop (since the desktop is out of commission), the first
thing I wanted to do was add my last journal entry, only to find that <i>my
journal file was missing!</i> The <code>feb19to25.html</code> file I had been
editing all week was just not there. I'll check on the web server in the
classroom to see if I have a backup. It had much valuable information in it,
and I'll really be sorry to loose it.  Well, when life gives you lemons,
<i>make lemonade!</i>
</p>

<h3>Lemonade</h3>
<p>
My first goal for the week will be to get more students using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>. Since I don't every
want to loose my journal again, the first thing I did this week was to add
it to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)">repository
</a> and put it on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/pcbtechjournal">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Back to the Plan</h3>
<p>
My main goal this week will be to revise and update the
<a href="http://ict.gctaa.net/sections/resources/journal.html">Weekly BPL
Technical Journal</a> page and introduce it to all my classes to help lead
students down the path of self-directed learning.  I had created a seperate
version of this document for each section, but given the work involved in
refining it, having a single instance linked from all sections will make the
work much more bearable.
</p>


<h2>Day 2 - Monday, Feb. 27</h2>
<p>
Exceptionally bad days tend to be followed by better ones (a simple statistical
fact). When I arrived in school today I found the missing journal file on the
classroom webserver. I copied it over to the rackspace server and commited it
to my git repository. It had useful information that I was happy to recover.
I plan to begin introducing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">github</a> to a few selected
students today. I'll choose students who are already doing very well in the
class and who can handle the extra learning load. Later I'll ask them to help
spread the knowledge to others.
</p><p>
I demoed git to two students in class who will learn it this week and then
share what they learn with classmates starting next week.
</p>


<h2>Day 3 - Tuesday, Feb. 28</h2>
<p>
Marco has been working on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How-to">How-to</a> for using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">screen</a> to share a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console">virtual console</a>
among the students in the class. This will allow us to write code together,
and provide an opportunity to practice interactive discipline, timing, and
effective communication at the same time we are learning Python, etc.
I'm coming in earnly tomorrow morning, so I plan to use that opportunity to
test out Marco's latest incarnation of the the How-to and share how it works
here.
</p><p>
In other news, the APS network lost
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> last night
during my evening class. In the past, this would have brought classwork to
a halt, but with the inhouse network Marco setup for us, students were able to
continue working without missing a beat!
</p>


<h2>Day 4 - Wednesday, March 1</h2>

<h3>7:30 am</h3>
<p>
Here is what I did as a first attempt at setting up a shared screen session:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Logged into rteitelbaum, the laptop connected to the projector in the
  front of the classroom.  Started an X terminal session and sshed from there
  to the ebgranville classroom web server.</li>

  <li>Logged in (using ssh) to ebgranville from my desktop workstation,
  ghopper, and ran the following commands:
  <pre>
  $ sudo chmod u+s $(which screen)
  $ sudo chmod 755 /var/run/screen 
  </pre></li>

  <li>Confirmed that my <code>.screenrc</code> file had the following:
  <pre>
  multiuser on

  # Grant users access to screen sessions
  acladd [username]
  ...
  acladd [username]
  </pre>
  and that my <code>.bash_aliases</code> file contained the following:
  <pre>
  # screen aliases
  screens() { screen -aAOS $1;}
  </pre></li>

  <li>Typed:
  <pre>
  $ screens sharedscreen1
  </pre>
  in the projected virtual console.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Marco's instructions don't explain how users connect to a screen session, so
I'll have to wait for him to read this and revise his instructions in response
before testing further.
</p>

<h3>11:30 am - Getting back to Flask</h3>
<p>
I mentioned <a href="feb19to25.html">last week</a> that I reached a dead end
with the <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>. It was way over my head and I
found myself blindly copying and pasting with no real comprehension at all.
My next attempt was the book, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/instant-flask-web-development-instant">Instant Flask Web Development</a>, by
Ron DuPlain. I found the explainations in this book to be excellent.
Unfortunately, the August 2013 publication date means the book is way out of
date, so this wasn't usable either. I will now attempt to use the
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/">Tutorial</a> from the
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask website</a>. Since it appears to
contain a stripped down version of the microblog app from the Flask
Mega-Tutorial, I decided to use the
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/flaskmicroblog">same GitHub repository</a>
I used for the Mega-Tutorial, after using <code>git rm</code> to remove most
of what was there (still keeping it in the project history in case I want it
later) and ready myself to begin anew.
</p>


<h2>Day 5 - Thursday, March 2</h2>

<h3>9:00 am - Meeting with Micky and Charlie</h3>
<p>
Wow, what a morning! I had a long awaited phone conference with
<a href="http://platformcoop.net/2016/participants/micky-metts">Micky Metts</a>
and <a href="http://charliereisinger.com/">Charlie Reisinger</a>. It was
everything I had hoped it would be and more. Immediately thereafter, as if by
divine intervention, two of our School Board members walked into my building
and I took the opportunity to hand them a copy of Charlie's book,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Schoolhouse-Building-Technology-Transform/dp/1537484052">The Open Schoolhouse: Building a Technology Program to Transform Learning and Empower Students</a>.
Let's see what good things can come from this. I'm hoping we'll look back later
and view this as the seed from which grew <i>The Coalition of Open
Schoolhouses</i>.
</p>

<h3>12:30 pm - A Shared Screen Session</h3>
<p>
Six of us shared a single screen session and wrote Python together to transform
an augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form. After modifying
<code>.screenrc</code> and <code>.bash_aliases</code> as described in
yesterday's post, here is the process:
</p>
<h4>Screen Sharer Setup</h4>
<p>
Use ssh to connect from the presentation laptop to the in class web server and
run the following commands:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 20px;">
$ sudo chmod 755 /var/run/screen
$ screens sharedscreen
</pre>

<h4>Connecting to the Shared Screen</h4>
<p>
Users can then connect to the shared screen by sshing into the classroom
webserver and running:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 20px;">
$ sreen -x [username of screensharer]/
</pre>
<p>
<i>Note:</i> the <code>username/</code> following <code>-x</code> assumes only
a single screen is being shared.  If there are more than one shared screens,
then:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 20px;">
$ sreen -x [username of screensharer]/[screenname]
</pre>
<p>
would be required.
</p>

<h3>8:30 pm - Finished microblog Flask App</h3>
<p>
I finished a working version of the microblog Flask app and updated my
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/flaskmicroblog">flaskmicroblog</a> GitHub
repo. I'm exhausted, but all in all it was a fantastic day!
</p>

<h2>Day 6 - Friday, March 3: Evaluation</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/mjsir911">Marco</a> came in today and told me
about
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/kjcole">Kevin Cole</a> had told me about this
earlier, but Marco's reminding me about it now was super timely, since we have
several students in class ready to take advantage of this.  I just moved my
journal to GitHub Pages, and plan to help other students do the same thing
next week.
</p><p>
Getting students to manage their own self-directed learning is an ongoing
process. I believe this week accomplished several goals successfully toward
this goal. I updated the
<a href=http://ict.gctaa.net/sections/resources/journal.html">Weekly BPL
Technical Journal</a> page, including making the rubric more concrete and
descriptive, adding the idea of
<a href="http://www.ctillustrated.com/portfolio/ctp-2-producing-computational-artifacts">computational artifacts</a> as the products that students should
create each week and to which they should link from their technical journals to
consider them complete.
</p><p>
By setting up the in classroom web server I was able to help deepen student's
understanding of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">ssh</a> and introduce them
to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy">scp</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>. Being reintroduced to
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a>
was icing on the cake.
</p><p>
All-in-all, it was a very productive week.
