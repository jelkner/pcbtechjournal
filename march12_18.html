<h2>Day 1 - Monday, March 13: The Plan</h2>
<p>
In addition to getting every student connected to a project or two, my goal for
this week will be to focus on the
<a href="http://ict.gctaa.net/sections/itd256/">ITD 256</a> students, helping
to develop a plan to address the curricular requirements for that course.

<h2>Day 2 - Tuesday, March 14</h2>
<p>
Snow day today, so I'll have time to do some studying! ;-)
</p>

<h3>ER Diagrams</h3>
<p>
First order of business is to identify the best Ubuntu tool for creating
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER
models</a>.  A quick search led me to
<a href="https://umbrello.kde.org/">Umbrello</a>, which I installed with:
</p>
<pre class="shell">
$ sudo apt install umbrello
</pre>
<p>
The
<a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable4/en/kdesdk/umbrello/uml-elements.html#entity-relationship-diagram">ER diagram documentation</a> has a screenshot that
appears promising.

</p><p>
The task now will be to get Martin to learn to use this! I came up with a
project for Owen and Martin to work on which I am calling
<q>Virginia Votes</q>. The goal will be to setup a database using publically
accessible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set">data sets</a> to
provide voters with information about their state and local elections and
elected officials.
</p>

<h3>Postgis Server</h3>
<p>
For a project like VA Votes, we will need a publically available database,
preferably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a>
with geospatial extensions (i.e.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostGIS">PostGIS</a>). I woke up this
morning intending to setup one up on a server I already have available, and
found out I had done this on the intended server already. Next time we have
class I'll get Martin setup as a database admin on it.
</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
The beginnings of a list of available data sources includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ballotpedia.org">Ballotpedia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
To help me understand the political geography of the voting process, my first
question is how are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precinct">election
precincts</a> determined?  The website
<a href="http://redistricting.lls.edu/who.php">All About Redistricting</a>
appears to be a good place to start.
