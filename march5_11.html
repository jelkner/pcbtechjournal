<h1>Journal for Week of March 5 to 11, 2017</h1>

<main>
<h2>Day 1 - Sunday, March 5: The Plan</h2>
<p>
This week I plan to direct students into group projects that will allow them
to work collaboratively. There are several projects that have emerged either
directly from student interests or from our Career Center community. Two in
particular are a <q>senior project</q> idea from one student to create a
mobile app for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefield_High_School_(Arlington_County,_Virginia)">Wakefield High School</a>
students and a website for the interdisciplinary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly">Monarch butterfly</a>
project at the
<a href="https://careercenter.apsva.us">Arlington Career Center</a>. The goal
will be to get most students hooked up with a project over the next few weeks.
</p>

<h3>Personal Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
In terms of my own self-directed learning, I plan to investigate
whether the soon to be rolled out
<a href="https://code.org/educate/applab">App Lab</a> export feature that
<a href="https://github.com/pcardune">Paul Carduner</a> told me is ready for
testing would be a viable solution for the Wakefield High School app.
</p><p>
Time permitting I will also continue studying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)">Flask</a>, the
the specific goal of building on the
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/flaskmicroblog">microblog</a> I created
from the official website
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial">Tutorial</a> last week.
I'll choose some combination of the following three tasks to focus on:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add proper authentication</li>
  <li>Add support for writing blog posts in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">ReStructuredText</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Improve the appearance of the current templates.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Day 2 - Monday, March 6</h2>

<h3>App Lab</h3>
<p>
To begin testing the
<a href="https://code.org/educate/applab">App Lab</a> exporter, I did the
following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>created a small application called
  <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/YslCWPttjVPLiwIrXZUElQ">
  NumbersIn4Languages</a> that has text input and a button and uses two
  screens.</li>

  <li>added <code>?enableExperiments=applab-export</code> to the end of the
  project URL.</li>

  <li>clicked <q>Share</q>, then <q>Show advanced options</q>, and then
  <q>Export</q>.</li>

  <li>downloaded the <code>NumbersIn4Languages.zip</code> file, copied it
  to the classroom webserver and unzipped it in my <code>public_html</code>
  directory.</li>

  <li>viewed it from my workstation browser and from my phone.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Tomorrow I'll take a look under the hood.
</p>

<h3>Flask</h3>
<p>
The top Flask priority at present is to get the
<a href="https://github.com/nwheele3/novaweb">novaweb</a> Flask application
that <a href="https://github.com/nwheele3">Nick Wheeler</a> created for
<a href="http://novawebdevelopment.com">NOVA Web Development</a> for his
senior project for his 
<a href="https://masononline.gmu.edu/programs/information-technology-degree-completion-program-bs/">Information Technology</a> degree at
<a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a>.
</p><p>
Former NOVA Web Development coop member Chris Hedrick made his own branch of
the <a href="https://github.com/cmhedrick/novaweb-1">novaweb</a> application,
which Marco has in turn forked into the coop repository
<a href="https://github.com/novawebdevelopment/novaweb">here</a>. The first
task will be to get it running.
</p>


<h2>Day 3 - Tuesday, March 7</h2>

<h3>Setting Up a <code>novaweb</code> Machine</h3>
<p>
Since it lacks a <code>requirements.txt</code> file or a
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/">virtualenv</a>, and since both
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)">Flask</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a> have changed
significantly over the past two years, here is what I did to start trying to
get the <a href="https://github.com/novawebdevelopment/novaweb">novaweb</a>
application running again:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Setup a virtual machine (using KVM) running Ubuntu 14.04 server.</li>

  <li>Ran:<pre>
  $ sudo apt install mysql-server python-flask python-flask-login git
  </pre></li>

  <li>Ran:<pre>
  git clone git@github.com:novawebdevelopment/novaweb.git
  </pre></li>
</ol>
<p>
I set the MySQL root user password to <code>novaweb</code>. I'm taking this
approach since the application was created two years ago, and it was either
running on Debian or Ubuntu (probably, Debian, now that I think about it,
but this is approach will probably have similiar enough versions of the
required software). I want to avoid changes in the module import behavior of
Flask, so I'm hoping the version installed from the distribution repository
will work with the application.
</p><p>
After following the process described above and launching
<code>runserver.py</code>, I encountered the error with a missing
<code>config.py</code> file. That makes sense, since configuration information
shouldn't be kept in a source repository, but now I need to figure out how
to recreate the file. Marco told me that we have a version of this application
on our
<a href="https://www.webfaction.com">WebFaction</a> account.  I'll ask him
about that when he comes in today.
</p>

<h3>Spring Projects and RESTful APIs</h3>
<p>
One of my overarching goals from the beginning of this school year was to
develop projects that combined the following tools/technologies in various
ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
  <li>App Inventor</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Linux system administration and servers</li>
</ol>
<p>
One combination of these technologies could be useful for many projects:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app">mobile applications</a>
created with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Inventor_for_Android">
App Inventor</a> that communicate through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web services</a> with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>
application talking to an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>.
</p><p>
To get started down the path of creating this type of application, I plan to
learn to implement a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful
</a> web service application using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)">Flask</a>.
I found a tutorial to get started with this,
<a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask">Designing a RESTful API with Python and Flask</a>.
I will begin with that presently.
</p>


<h2>Day 4, Wednesday, March 8</h2>

<h3>The RESTful ToDo List Moves Forward</h3>
<p>
I created a GitHub repository for my
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/flasktodo">Flask ToDo List</a> application
and completed the
<a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask">tutorial</a> I'm using up to the <i>Improving the web service
interface</i> section.  As soon as the tutorial is complete, I'll look into
adding two things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>An SQLite database to store ToDo items.</li>
  <li>A single user authentication system to control access.</li>
</ol>
