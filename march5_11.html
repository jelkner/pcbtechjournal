<h1>Journal for Week of March 5 to 11, 2017</h1>

<h2>Day 1 - Sunday, March 5: The Plan</h2>
<p>
This week I plan direct students into group projects that will allow them
to work collaboratively. There are several projects that have emerged either
directly from student interests or from our Career Center community. Two in
particular are a <q>senior project</q> idea from one student to create a
mobile app for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefield_High_School_(Arlington_County,_Virginia)">Wakefield High School</a>
students and a website for the interdisciplinary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly">Monarch butterfly</a>
project at the
<a href="https://careercenter.apsva.us">Arlington Career Center</a>. The goal
will be to get most students hooked up with a project over the next few weeks.
</p>

<h3>Personal Learning Goals</h3>
<p>
In terms of my own self-directed learning, I plan to investigate
whether the soon to be rolled out
<a href="https://code.org/educate/applab">App Lab</a> export feature that
<a href="https://github.com/pcardune">Paul Carduner</a> told me is ready for
testing would be a viable solution for the Wakefield High School app.
</p><p>
Time permitting I will also continue studying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)">Flask</a>, the
the specific goal of building on the
<a href="https://github.com/jelkner/flaskmicroblog">microblog</a> I created
from the official website
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial">Tutorial</a> last week.
I'll choose some combination of the following three tasks to focus on:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add proper authentication</li>
  <li>Add support for writing blog posts in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">ReStructuredText</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Improve the appearance of the current templates.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Day 2 - Monday, March 6</h2>
<p>
To begin testing the
<a href="https://code.org/educate/applab">App Lab</a> exporter, I did the
following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>created a small application called
  <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/YslCWPttjVPLiwIrXZUElQ">
  NumbersIn4Languages</a> that has text input and a button and uses two
  screens.</li>

  <li>added <code>?enableExperiments=applab-export</code> to the end of the
  project URL.</li>

  <li>clicked <q>Share</q>, then <q>Show advanced options</q>, and then
  <q>Export</q>.</li>

  <li>saved the <code>NumbersIn4Languages.zip</code> file in my
  <code>Downloads</code> directory.</li>
</ol>
